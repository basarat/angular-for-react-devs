# TODO: 
* ng-if
* ng-switch
* ng-click

# Abstract chores
## Conditional display 
* React : use `&&`. OR `?:` or `if else`
* Angular : use `ng-if`

## For loop 
* React: use `.map` on your arrays
* ng-for
  * worth mentioning that ng-for public api has changed e.g. NgFor to NgForOf


## Global Handlers 
* React use `addEventListener` / `removeEventListener`
* Angular : Use angular specific apis. [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36123380/global-events-window-onresize-didnt-change-the-local-variables-value/36135449#36135449)

## Intellisence 
* React: Built into TypeScript.
* Angular: Seperate plugin by the angular team.

## Formatters 
pipes (Just use JavaScript functions that are completely independent of framework)

## HTML Reuse
* Here is a piece of HTML that you need to duplicate. Do it in React, Do it in Angular

## Transclusion 
* Just pass VNodes around instead of lots of framework code.
* Multi-slot Transclusion : Just adding more concepts without much value.
