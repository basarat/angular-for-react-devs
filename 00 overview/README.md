# Overview
Let's be very clear about the *main* reason you are considering about either of these:

1. You have data 
2. You have UI that shows this data (need a lib for this) and allows the user to change this data (need a lib for this)
3. When data changes you want the UI to change (need a lib for this).

Both Angular and React can fill in this _you need a lib for this_ gap in your UI development process. How they do them is fundamentally different.
